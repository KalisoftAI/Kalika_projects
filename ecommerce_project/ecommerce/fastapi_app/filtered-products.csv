<p>Reliability: Once tightened, Bolts will remain tight and maintain the permanent strength of the joint, Absence of heavy stress concentration due to absence of bearing between bolts and plates. Economy: Fewer high strength bolts are required than M.S. bolts and rivets. Drilling of close holes is not required. Overall weight the structure will be very light. Simplicity: A minimum of skill is required in tightening and the operators need only to follow a few simple rules. Convenience: Whether in the workshop or at site, H.S.S bolts enable joints to be made easily. Welding of site splices can be eliminated, avoiding difficulties of welding in adverse weather conditions. Absence of pneumatic, hammers used in riveted joints reduce noise level considerably.</p>

<p><b>PTFE (Polytetrafluorethylene sometimes referred to as Teflon) is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic that has low strength and rigidity but a wealth of other unique properties that make it a high performance product. The main attributes of PTFE plastic are its high thermal stability, excellent chemical resistance and excellent sliding properties. Parts made of PTFE tend to generate lower friction and heat, which increases the life of the parts made from it and reduces maintenance costs. The very high sliding properties of PTFE mean that the surfaces can slide over each other with low friction resistance known as low coefficient of friction. This reduces wear and tear making this plastic ideal for use in component such as bearings.</b></p>

Features:

1. Surface contact between impact and belt let stress evenly spread on belt;smooth surface of UHMWPE board makes friction lowest, effectively weaken damage to belt, dramatically reduce daily maintenance coat and increase production rate

2. Effectively eliminate the spillage and scattering of the material caused by uneven stress on the belt

3. Guiding angle on UHMWPE board of impact bar guarantee belt running smoothly
